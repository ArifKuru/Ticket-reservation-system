This project was my second-semester project in object-oriented programming lecture. I used the following features:

- Data members
- Member functions
- Validation in set functions using if, for, while, etc. structures
- Overloading and function templates
- Defining default values for constructor parameters
- Include guards
- Destructor function
- Static variables and functions
- Friend functions
- Composition

This system allows users to:
- Reserve tickets and save the ticket details, including their name, surname, and phone number

It also allows administrators to:
- Add new events
- Edit existing events
- Check sold tickets
